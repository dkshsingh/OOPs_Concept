### 1. Class 
    A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created. It is a logical entity that contains     some attributes and methods. 
    
#### some points on Python class    
    - classes are created by keyword class.
    - Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
    - Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Eg.: Myclass.Myattribute
    
### Class  definiton syntax:
    class Classname:
    #statement1
    .
    .
    .
    #statement2
    
    Example:
    class Dog:
        pass
### 2. Object
    The object is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it. It may be any real-world object like a mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc. Integers, strings, floating-point numbers, even arrays, and dictionaries, are all objects.
     
 #### an object consists of    
     - State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
     - Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.
     - Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.
